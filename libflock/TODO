Use getopt_long in flockUtils.

Store group and record mode in flock/birds.  Get flock status for
initial values.

Timestamped records.

Error codes.

Standalone/flock mode.

Sleep/don't sleep.  Several commands require time to be executed by a
flock.  The client should know this.  But maybe he can do something
else than sleeping while the flock executes a command.  Would it be
the library to call sleep, or the client ?

Compute the size of command data and response without ambiguity.  The
implementation is incomplete right now with regard to the
specification of flock of birds, as found in the guide.  This requires
to maintain a state for each flock, with current record size,
streaming, group mode, addressing mode, etc.

Old flocks don't have the same interface as new ones.  How can we
manage this?

Can we guess the number of birds connected to a flock, and which one
has a transmitter and/or receiver?  Maybe we can examine the status of
each bird.

Rewrite libflock.m4.
